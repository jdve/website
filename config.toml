This means never falling into the trap of using a hammer to solve every
problem like it's a nail. For me, this philospopy has given me the
privilege of using many different programming languages and frameworks[^1]
note, recognizing that each one has its areas of strengths and
weaknesses. And that's the fun of it [^2]!

[^1]: To name a few, AWS (including Lambdas), C/C++, .NET (especially
C#), Docker/Mesos/Marathon, Elasticsearch, frontend web (including
Angular and CoffeeScript), Java, Groovy, Python (including Django and
Flask), RabbitMQ, and Scala.

[^2]: I love experimenting with the bleeding edge. For many years,
this led me towards fringe operating systems (like BeOS). Today, I
enjoy playing with less mainstream programming languages (like Haskell
and Nim).
