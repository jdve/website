[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is awesome.  In fact, that's what this
site is hosted on.  It's easy, it's free.  What's not to love?  So when I
thought about refreshing our website at [Vihanti Digital
Services](https://www.vihanti.com), I assumed that's what I'd use as well.

Then, thanks to [@myobie](https://nathanherald.com/writing/going-public/), I
heard about [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/new).  Goodness.  It's amazing!  They
provide free hosting for smaller sites as well, and it's fully integrated with
git, just like Github Pages.  In addition, though, they provide a full
continuous deployment framework.  Each pull request gets automatically deployed
to a new URL.  This means that deploying to prod is just an instantaneous
switch.  They also provide syntax highlighted logs, so you can see what's going
on during a deployment.  Beautiful!

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is another similar service that also looks
great.  I haven't tried it (yet!), but I'm impressed by their addon features.
For example, they support contact forms that automatically populate
within the dashboard.  No third-party service needed!  In the meantime, I'm
quite happy with [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/).  It does everything I
need.
