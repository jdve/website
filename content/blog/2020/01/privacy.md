If you've ever tried to add a privacy policy or terms of service to your
website, you know the pain.  Just try searching for "privacy policy template" in
Google, and you'll be overwhelmed with "free generators" that are only sort of
free.  Not only do they intentionally leave out the important parts of the
policy unless you pay, many of them also seem quite poorly written.

Thankfully, [BaseCamp](https://basecamp.com/) has generously [open
sourced](https://github.com/basecamp/policies) their privacy policy and terms of
service!  Plus, their version is actually readable by normal humans, unlike so
many that are filled with legal jargon.
