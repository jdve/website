The privacy of your data--and it is your data, not ours!-- is a big deal to us.
We log all access to our website by IP address, so we can always verify that no
unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.

## Identity & Access

When you fill out our contact form, we ask for your name and email address.
That's just a convenience, so that you can email us right from the website.  We
use [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) to do this. We’ll never sell your
personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in
marketing statements without your permission, either.

When you write us with a question or to ask for help, we'll keep that
correspondence, and the email address, for future reference. When you browse our
marketing pages, we'll track that for statistical purposes (like conversion
rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer,
like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.

The only times we’ll ever share your info:

* To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission.
* To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities,
  suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety
  of any person, violations of our [Terms of Service](/terms), or as
  otherwise required by law.

## Your Rights With Respect to Your Information

You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in
Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to
their personal information collected by us on the Site. Accordingly, we
recognizes and will comply with GDPR and those rights, except as limited by
applicable law. The rights under GDPR include:

* **Right of Access.** This includes your right to access the personal
  information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about
  the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.
* **Right to Correction.** This is your right to request correction of your
  personal information.
* **Right to Erasure.** This is your right to request, subject to certain
  limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased
  from our possession (also known as the “Right to be forgotten”).  However, if
  applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your
  information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using our
  services.
* **Right to Complain.** You have the right to make a complaint regarding our
  handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory
  authority.
* **Right to Restrict Processing.** This is your right to request restriction of
  how and why your personal information is used or processed.
* **Right to Object.** This is your right, in certain situations, to object to
  how or why your personal information is processed.
* **Right to Portability.** This is your right to receive the personal
  information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
* **Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.** This is your right
  to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly
  significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated
  processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for
  performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable
  European law, or is based on your explicit consent.

If you have questions about exercising these rights or need
assistance, please contact us at
[hello@jdve.me](mailto:hello@jdve.me).

## Processors We Use

As part of the services we provide, and only to the extent necessary, we may use
certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal
information. Here are the processors we use:

* [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com/). Domain name registrar.
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Web hosting.
* [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/). Email forms.

## Law Enforcement

We won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we
have to. We flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when
they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from
it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made.

## Security & Encryption

All data is encrypted via
[SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when
transmitted from our servers to your browser.

## Location of Site and Data

This Site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European
Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any
information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using
our Site, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your
information, you consent to this transfer.

## Changes & Questions

We may update this policy once in a blue moon.
